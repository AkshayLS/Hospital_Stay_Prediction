# Project Overview
Covid-19 Pandemic has raised alarms over one of the most overlooked area to focus: Healthcare Management. While healthcare management has various use cases for using data science, patient length of stay is one critical parameter to observe and predict if one wants to improve the efficiency of the healthcare management in a hospital.

This parameter helps hospitals to identify patients of high LOS risk (patients who will stay longer) at the time of admission. Once identified, patients with high LOS risk can have their treatment plan optimized to miminize LOS and lower the chance of staff/visitor infection. Also, prior knowledge of LOS can aid in logistics such as room and bed allocation planning.

# Goal
The goal of this project is to accurately predict the Length of Stay for each patient on case by case basis so that the Hospitals can use this information for optimal resource allocation and better functioning.

# Code 
Please refer the ipynb notebook for a detailed walkthrough of the entire project.

# Evalation Metric
We will be using the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area under the curve (ROC AUC score) Metric. The ROC curve is useful for predicting the probability of outcome being in a certain class. One benefit of the ROC curves is that different models can be compared directly in general using the area under the curve (AUC) measurement. A higher AUC score means a better model.
